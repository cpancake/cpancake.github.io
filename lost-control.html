    <p>This is a bit different than the rest of the posts on this blog; this has nothing to do with programming. It's about music. </p>
<p>One of my favorite artists is Uppermost. At the moment, my Last.fm account records 1,849 plays of his music. That's more than any other artist I've listened to. But Uppermost has a large body of work other than what he releases. His six albums (Action, Polis, One, Control, Revolution, and Evolution) and singles account for only a fraction of his work. He releases much more than that on his Soundcloud and MySpace pages, as well as on his website. </p>
<p>Some of these tracks make it on to his album (like Independent and Passion). Others never made it that far. Though some of these are still on the aforementioned websites, some of them aren't available for download anymore. So I thought I'd take some of my collection of tracks of his and release them. I call this "Lost Control," because the tracks I picked are in sort of the same chill-out style that Control has. I have plenty of tracks from his deadmau5 days as well as from his post-Action complextro days. Tell me if you want them!</p>
<p>Here's the track list:</p>
<ol>
<li>A Fallen Soul</li>
<li>Life Story</li>
<li>Verite</li>
<li>Photoelectric</li>
<li>a failure.</li>
<li>Awake</li>
<li>Other World</li>
<li>Feelings</li>
<li>Everlasting</li>
<li>Before Daybreak</li>
<li>Out of Line</li>
<li>Thud</li>
<li>Don't Forget The Sun</li>
<li>Feel Alive</li>
<li>Firelighter</li>
<li>My Beloved Soul</li>
<li>Overnight</li>
<li>Saving The World</li>
<li>Rise</li>
<li>Reminder</li>
<li>Discover Life</li>
</ol>
<p>Tracks 2-4 came from the Free Tracks page on Uppermost's website, which isn't available anymore. 5-12 came from his alonely alternate SoundCloud account, and 14-21 came from his current SoundCloud account. I have no idea where A Fallen Soul comes from, but it's a good song.</p>
